## Summary
Flip 7 Calculator is a score-tracking utility. **We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data.** The app works offline.

## Data We Collect
**None.**  
Flip 7 Calculator does not collect data about you and does not send any information to our servers (we do not operate any servers for the app).

## Data Stored on Your Device
The app stores limited information **locally on your device** using Apple’s standard on-device storage (e.g., `UserDefaults`) to provide core functionality and preferences, such as:
- Player names and roster (for convenience)
- Current game state (so you can resume)
- Deck/profile settings
- App preferences (theme, haptics, UI options)

This data stays on your device unless you choose to back up your device using Apple backup services (e.g., iCloud device backup), which are controlled by Apple and your device settings.

## Tracking
Flip 7 Calculator **does not track you** across apps or websites and does not use the iOS App Tracking Transparency framework.

## Third-Party Services
Flip 7 Calculator **does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting SDKs**.

## Permissions
Flip 7 Calculator does not require access to sensitive device features such as location, contacts, photos, camera, microphone, or Bluetooth.

## Children’s Privacy
Flip 7 Calculator does not knowingly collect personal information from children (or anyone). Because the app does not collect data, there is nothing for us to share or monetize.

## Changes to This Policy
If we change this privacy policy, we will update the **Effective date** above and publish the updated policy at the same location.
